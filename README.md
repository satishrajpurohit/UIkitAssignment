### UIkitAssignment

## This UIKit project provides a dynamic image carousel, a list of items, a search feature, and a floating action button (FAB) with a bottom sheet for statistics. The app is designed to handle any number of items and images dynamically, with a built-in feature to filter the list through a search bar and visualize statistics in a bottom sheet.

## Xcode Compatibility

- This project was developed using **Xcode 16** (or the latest stable release) and is **recommended** to be opened with **Xcode 16** or later for optimal performance.

## Key Features
- Image Carousel: A horizontally swipeable carousel that updates the list based on the selected image.
- Dynamic List: Scrollable list with real-time updates based on the images in the carousel.
- Sticky Search Bar: A pinned search bar that filters list items as the user types.
- Floating Action Button (FAB): Triggers a bottom sheet displaying:
- The count of items on the page.
- The top 3 most frequent characters in the list.

## Architecture Overview

This project follows a MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to separate the UI logic from the data processing and business logic. It uses UITableView for the list, UICollectionView for the carousel, and UITextField for search input. The bottom sheet is a custom modal view triggered by the floating action button.

Model: The data used by the app, such as CatImage and CatBreed.
View: The visual elements that represent the UI, including the carousel, list, search bar, and bottom sheet.
ViewModel: Handles the logic to fetch data and filter it for the UI, like fetching images from the network or counting character occurrences.
